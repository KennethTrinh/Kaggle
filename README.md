# Hello! Here are a few Kaggle competitions (the ones still publicly available) that I've participated in during my ~~dreadful~~ time at Cornell University.


1. Spoken Digit Pair Recognition

Leaderboard name: Jayadev

- This one was fun, but I spent way too long on it. ðŸ˜… I trained an 11-layer Convolutional Neural Net (CNN), which is surprisingly good for predicting audio ðŸŽ§. Some context: I was just an undergraduate junior at the time, taking some cancerous master's course with a bunch of PhD students ðŸ¤¯. They wanted us to use PyTorch apparently, but since I don't go to class, I ended up using TensorFlow ðŸ¤«. Anyway, I gaslighted everyone into thinking that the professor was in the competition by using his name and picture as my profile pic on the leaderboard ðŸ“‰.

2. Named Entity Recognition

Leaderboard name: Coin Flip Predictor

- I used a transformer architecture for this one ðŸ¤–. Why would you use anything other than the best NLP model? ðŸ¤” They wanted us to leverage Hidden Markov Models (HMM), but I told them that school is a scam ðŸŽ“, and we're not living in 1966 anymore ðŸ‘´.
